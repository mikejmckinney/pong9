# 🧠 Active Agent State
*Last Updated: 2026-01-14*

## 📍 Current Status
**Phase:** Phase 4 — Polish & Persistence 🔄 **IN PROGRESS**
**Active Task:** Power-up system implemented. Next: Firebase leaderboards and deployment.

## 📋 Context & Decisions
* Phase 4 implementation started
* Power-up system fully implemented on server and client
* Four power-up types: BIG_PADDLE, SHRINK_OPPONENT, SPEED_UP, SLOW_DOWN
* Power-ups spawn every 10 seconds with 50% chance when no active power-up exists
* Effects last 5 seconds then revert to normal
* Server handles all power-up logic (spawning, collision, effects)
* Client renders power-ups with synthwave-styled glowing animation

## ✅ Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Phase 1: Setup Phaser 3 + TypeScript + Vite environment
2. ✅ Phase 1: Implement Paddle/Ball Physics (Arcade Physics)
3. ✅ Phase 1: Implement Synthwave Graphics (PostFX Bloom, procedural grid, neon colors)
4. ✅ Phase 1: Implement Mobile Scale Manager (FIT mode, CENTER_BOTH)
5. ✅ Phase 1: Implement Touch Input system (split-screen zones for multiplayer)
6. ✅ Phase 1: Implement scoring system and game loop
7. ✅ Phase 1: Implement CRT overlay effects (scanlines, vignette)
8. ✅ Phase 1: Implement landscape orientation detection
9. ✅ Phase 1: Implement procedural audio (Web Audio API oscillators)
10. ✅ Phase 2: Setup npm workspaces monorepo structure
11. ✅ Phase 2: Create shared package with constants and interfaces
12. ✅ Phase 2: Setup Node.js + Colyseus Server
13. ✅ Phase 2: Define GameState and Player Schemas with @type() decorators
14. ✅ Phase 2: Implement GameRoom with "Waiting for Player" state
15. ✅ Phase 2: Create NetworkManager for client-side Colyseus connection
16. ✅ Phase 2: Add LobbyScene for multiplayer connection flow
17. ✅ Phase 2: Integrate network support in GameScene

20. ✅ Phase 3: Implement server simulation loop at 60Hz with drift compensation
21. ✅ Phase 3: Add client-side interpolation for ball and remote paddle
22. ✅ Phase 3: Add local paddle prediction for responsive feel
23. ✅ Phase 3: Disable local physics in networked mode (server authoritative)
24. ✅ Phase 4: Implement Power-Up system (server-side spawning and collision)
25. ✅ Phase 4: Add PowerUp and ActiveEffect schemas
26. ✅ Phase 4: Implement paddle scaling effects
27. ✅ Phase 4: Implement ball speed modifiers
